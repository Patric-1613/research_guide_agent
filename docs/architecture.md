# Architecture

This document describes two things: the architecture as it actually exists
today, and the target layered architecture this project is migrating toward
incrementally (see `specs/migration-plan.md` for the phased plan). Nothing in
this document changes behavior — it's a map, not a refactor.

The existing top-level `README.md` and `research_agent_architecture.svg`
describe the original single-pipeline research agent (search → dedup →
rank → summarize/chat). That description is still accurate for that part of
the system, but predates the curation/report/chat system and the React UI
added afterward — this document fills that gap and is the more current
source of truth for anything under `research_agent/curation_*`, `report.py`,
`qa.py`, and `frontend/`.

## Current architecture

**Phase 2 (API split) is complete as of 2026-07-29.** `research_agent/api.py`
is now a thin, backward-compatible entrypoint — `uvicorn research_agent.api:
app` still boots the exact same app object it always has, and every response
shape is byte-for-byte unchanged — but every actual route handler has moved
out into `research_agent/api_app/routers/`. `api.py` itself now holds:
top-level imports, shared module-level state (`_state`, populated once in
`lifespan()`), every request/response Pydantic model, a handful of shared
serialization/error-guard helpers, and 12 `app.include_router(...)` calls
that wire the routers back onto the one live `app` object. There is still no
separate service layer — orchestration logic lives in the router handlers
now, not in `api.py`'s own handlers, but it hasn't moved any further than
that yet (see "Transition debt" below).

### Phase 2: API split — router inventory

Every router lives in `research_agent/api_app/routers/`, one file per
logical endpoint group (finer-grained than the six-file sketch originally
proposed in "Target architecture" below — grouping followed test-patch
boundaries and shared-helper usage rather than a fixed count decided up
front):

| Router file | Endpoint(s) |
|---|---|
| `health.py` | `GET /health` |
| `library.py` | `GET /library`, `GET /library/{search_id}` |
| `export.py` | `GET /export/{search_id}` |
| `summarize.py` | `POST /summarize` |
| `chat.py` | `POST /chat` (original one-shot pipeline) |
| `search.py` | `POST /search` (both the agent path and the `use_query_expansion=True` path) |
| `curation_core.py` | `POST /curation/start`, `POST /curation/{id}/picks` |
| `curation_sessions.py` | `GET /curation/reviews`, `GET /curation/{id}`, `DELETE /curation/{id}` |
| `curation_history.py` | `POST /curation/{id}/select-from-history`, `POST /curation/{id}/reopen` |
| `curation_reports.py` | `POST /curation/{id}/report`, `POST /curation/{id}/report/regenerate` |
| `curation_chat.py` | `POST /curation/{id}/chat` |

### Why `research_agent/api_app/`, not `research_agent/api/`

The original Phase 2 design called for converting `api.py` into a package —
`research_agent/api/app.py` plus an `__init__.py` re-exporting `app` and
every test-patched name. A review caught a real, verified bug in that plan
before any code moved: `unittest.mock.patch.object(api, "name")` mutates
whichever module a function's `__globals__` actually points to — the module
it's *physically defined in* — not whatever re-exports that name elsewhere.
A wildcard re-export (`from .app import *`) only copies names into the
package's own dict once, at import time; it doesn't alias the two dicts.
Patching `research_agent.api.chat_turn` afterward would only touch the
package's copy, while a handler physically relocated into `app.py` would
still resolve its own bare-name call against `app.py`'s dict, unaffected —
silently running the real function instead of the mock in what's supposed
to be a fully deterministic, offline test suite. Confirmed directly with an
isolated scratch reproduction before accepting the fix, not assumed.

The fix: never rename or relocate `api.py` at all. `research_agent/api_app/`
is an entirely separate, temporary package name specifically so it can
exist *alongside* the still-live `api.py` with zero import collision at
any point, ever. Every moved handler that needs a dependency tests patch
(`build_candidate_pool`, `chat_turn`, `run_research_agent`, `ask`, etc.) does
`import research_agent.api as api` and calls `api.<name>(...)` — a fresh
attribute lookup against the *original, still-patchable* module, at call
time, every call — never a `from research_agent.<module> import <name>`
binding, which would capture a reference immune to patching. Confirmed
empirically before this became policy, not assumed: a three-way scratch
test showed a relocated handler calling `api.name(...)` still sees the
patch, while one importing `name` directly does not.

### Transition debt this leaves for Phase 3

Phase 2 deliberately optimized for the smallest possible reviewable diff
per route move, not for architectural purity — the following is real,
known debt, not an oversight:

1. **Every router still calls back into `research_agent.api` as `api.<name>`
   for its shared dependencies.** This was the whole point during Phase 2
   (see above), but it means routers aren't actually decoupled from
   `api.py` yet — they're decoupled in *location* only.
2. **Every request/response Pydantic model still lives in `api.py`.** None
   were moved to a `schemas/` module — routers reference them as
   `api.SearchResponse`, `api.CurationStateResponse`, etc.
3. **Shared helpers still live in `api.py`.** `_upstream_error_guard`,
   `_state`, `_curation_config`, `_turn_result_to_response`,
   `_paper_to_out`/`_web_article_to_out`/`_paper_out_from_batch_entry`/
   `_report_to_out`/`_turn_history_out` — all of it, still in one file.
4. **Phase 3's job is specifically to resolve 1–3**: move orchestration
   logic into `services/*.py`, and move the schemas/helpers above into
   their own stable modules that routers import directly — at which point
   the `api.<name>` indirection this phase relied on stops being needed,
   since the underlying functions will have real, independent homes
   patchable in their own right, and `api.py` can shrink to just app
   construction and route registration.

### Validation recorded at the end of Phase 2 (2026-07-29)

```
uv run pytest -q                    → 342 passed
cd frontend && npm test             → 98 passed
cd frontend && npm run build        → clean (tsc -b && vite build)
```

Frontend structure today (already reasonably layered, see `specs/migration-
plan.md` Phase 7 for the small remaining moves):

```
frontend/src/
  App.tsx                 central orchestrator (workspace mode, routing state)
  hooks/useCurationSession.ts   the one stateful hook every component reads from
  api/client.ts, api/types.ts   typed fetch wrapper + response shapes
  components/
    ReviewMode/, ReportMode/, ChatMode/    the three workspace-mode panels
    ReviewsList/, TurnHistory/, TurnFeed/  left panel + turn scrollback/browser
    PaperPool/, WorkspaceMode/, AppHeader/, shared/
```

### Why LangGraph is used where it's used (not what makes this "agentic")

`qa.py` and `curation_loop.py` use `StateGraph` for two specific, non-agentic
reasons: **checkpointing** (SQLite-backed state that survives a restart or
refresh) and **`interrupt()`/`Command(resume=...)`** (pause execution until a
real HTTP request resumes it with the user's input). Every conditional edge
in both graphs is a plain Python function reading state you already computed
(`session.remaining() == 0`, `state["is_non_substantive"]`) — never a model
deciding the next node. `agent.py` is the one place in this codebase where
the model itself picks the next action (which tool to call, with what
arguments) — that's the actual agentic component.

## Target architecture

The direction (see `specs/migration-plan.md` for the phased path there,
which does **not** happen all at once):

```
UI  →  API  →  Services  →  Agents / Graphs / RAG / Sources  →  Storage / Repositories  →  Database
```

Concretely, for this project:

```
frontend/src/{pages,components,hooks,lib/api,types}/

research_agent/
  api/               the eventual final name -- currently realized as
                     api_app/ (see "Why research_agent/api_app/" above)
                     while api.py still needs to exist for backward
                     compatibility; renaming api_app/ -> api/ is a
                     separate future decision, not implied by Phase 3
    app.py            FastAPI app construction, middleware, lifespan
    dependencies.py    shared Depends() (checkpointer, client, db conn)
    schemas/           request/response Pydantic models, split by domain
    routers/           one file per logical endpoint group -- see the
                       router inventory table above for the current,
                       concrete list (11 files, not the 6 originally
                       sketched here; grouping followed test-patch
                       boundaries and shared-helper usage in practice)
  services/            orchestration currently living inline in api.py's
                       handlers moves here — search_service.py,
                       summary_service.py, chat_service.py,
                       curation_service.py, report_service.py
  agents/
    research_agent.py  from agent.py — unchanged logic, new location
  graphs/
    qa_graph.py         graph-building parts of qa.py
    curation_graph.py    from curation_loop.py
  rag/
    embeddings.py, ranking.py, retrieval.py
  sources/
    arxiv.py, semantic_scholar.py   (split out of ingestion.py)
    web.py                          (from web_search.py)
  db/ , storage/        repositories wrapping SQLite/Chroma access
  evals/                datasets/, runners/, evaluators/, cli.py
  config/               settings.py — env vars centralized, not hardcoded
                       across modules
  observability/        tracing.py's helpers

docs/                 architecture.md (this file), evaluation.md,
                     api-contracts.md, deployment.md, project-history.md
specs/                migration-plan.md, test-plan.md
```

The API/route surface and every response shape stay identical throughout —
this is a file-organization and dependency-direction change, not a behavior
change. Business logic (ranking math, the curation state machine, the QA
graph's routing) does not change; it only moves to a more conventional home
and gets a thin service function in front of it where orchestration logic
currently lives inline in a route handler.
