# Architecture

This document describes two things: the architecture as it actually exists
today, and the target layered architecture this project is migrating toward
incrementally (see `specs/migration-plan.md` for the phased plan). Nothing in
this document changes behavior — it's a map, not a refactor.

The existing top-level `README.md` and `research_agent_architecture.svg`
describe the original single-pipeline research agent (search → dedup →
rank → summarize/chat). That description is still accurate for that part of
the system, but predates the curation/report/chat system and the React UI
added afterward — this document fills that gap and is the more current
source of truth for anything under `research_agent/curation_*`, `report.py`,
`qa.py`, and `frontend/`.

## Current architecture

There is no separate service layer today — orchestration logic lives
directly inside `research_agent/api.py`'s route handlers, which call
straight into domain modules. Two of those domain modules are LangGraph
`StateGraph`s (used for checkpointed persistence and human-in-the-loop
pause/resume, not for autonomous decision-making — see the note at the
bottom); the rest are plain functions.

                       only job is giving the checkpointer something to

                         embeddings, keyed by paper_id, shared everywhere
  data/history.sqlite     original pipeline's saved-search records only
  data/qa_checkpoints.sqlite  LangGraph checkpointer DB — shared by qa.py's
                         (currently inactive) conversation persistence AND
                         every curation session (namespaced by thread_id
                         prefix "curation-session:")
  data/cache/             embedding cache
```

Frontend structure today (already reasonably layered, see `specs/migration-
plan.md` Phase 7 for the small remaining moves):

```
frontend/src/
  App.tsx                 central orchestrator (workspace mode, routing state)
  hooks/useCurationSession.ts   the one stateful hook every component reads from
  api/client.ts, api/types.ts   typed fetch wrapper + response shapes
  components/
    ReviewMode/, ReportMode/, ChatMode/    the three workspace-mode panels
    ReviewsList/, TurnHistory/, TurnFeed/  left panel + turn scrollback/browser
    PaperPool/, WorkspaceMode/, AppHeader/, shared/
```

### Why LangGraph is used where it's used (not what makes this "agentic")

`qa.py` and `curation_loop.py` use `StateGraph` for two specific, non-agentic
reasons: **checkpointing** (SQLite-backed state that survives a restart or
refresh) and **`interrupt()`/`Command(resume=...)`** (pause execution until a
real HTTP request resumes it with the user's input). Every conditional edge
in both graphs is a plain Python function reading state you already computed
(`session.remaining() == 0`, `state["is_non_substantive"]`) — never a model
deciding the next node. `agent.py` is the one place in this codebase where
the model itself picks the next action (which tool to call, with what
arguments) — that's the actual agentic component.

## Target architecture

The direction (see `specs/migration-plan.md` for the phased path there,
which does **not** happen all at once):

```
UI  →  API  →  Services  →  Agents / Graphs / RAG / Sources  →  Storage / Repositories  →  Database
```

Concretely, for this project:

```
frontend/src/{pages,components,hooks,lib/api,types}/

research_agent/
  api/
    app.py            FastAPI app construction, middleware, lifespan
    dependencies.py    shared Depends() (checkpointer, client, db conn)
    schemas/           request/response Pydantic models, split by domain
    routers/           health.py, search.py, summarize.py, chat.py,
                       curation.py, reports.py — thin: validate, call a
                       service, return
  services/            orchestration currently living inline in api.py's
                       handlers moves here — search_service.py,
                       summary_service.py, chat_service.py,
                       curation_service.py, report_service.py
  agents/
    research_agent.py  from agent.py — unchanged logic, new location
  graphs/
    qa_graph.py         graph-building parts of qa.py
    curation_graph.py    from curation_loop.py
  rag/
    embeddings.py, ranking.py, retrieval.py
  sources/
    arxiv.py, semantic_scholar.py   (split out of ingestion.py)
    web.py                          (from web_search.py)
  db/ , storage/        repositories wrapping SQLite/Chroma access
  evals/                datasets/, runners/, evaluators/, cli.py
  config/               settings.py — env vars centralized, not hardcoded
                       across modules
  observability/        tracing.py's helpers

docs/                 architecture.md (this file), evaluation.md,
                     api-contracts.md, deployment.md, project-history.md
specs/                migration-plan.md, test-plan.md
```

The API/route surface and every response shape stay identical throughout —
this is a file-organization and dependency-direction change, not a behavior
change. Business logic (ranking math, the curation state machine, the QA
graph's routing) does not change; it only moves to a more conventional home
and gets a thin service function in front of it where orchestration logic
currently lives inline in a route handler.
