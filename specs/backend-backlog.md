# Backend backlog

**Status: capture/tracking document. No implementation happens here.**
Companion to `specs/legacy-cleanup-audit.md` (Phase 18A). Written against
tag `standardized-single-user-project`. Purpose: give future backend bug
fixes and feature work a single place to land, without re-litigating the
already-closed standardization arc (Phases 0–17) or the deferred
production-readiness arc (`specs/production-readiness-roadmap.md`,
Phase 18).

## 1. Known bugs

No currently-open bug is documented anywhere in this repo's docs, specs,
or test files as of this audit — not invented here, and not claimed
where none exists. (The mentor-review bugs from 2026-07-17 were all
found already fixed against the current codebase — see the Obsidian
vault's `Mentor-Feedback.md` for that full accounting; nothing from that
review carries forward as open.)

Placeholders below, ready for real entries:

## 2. Backend feature ideas

Two are already documented in this repo (`README.md`'s "Known
limitations" section) and listed here with their source reference, not
invented:

### Author-name parsing for multi-word surnames
- **Source**: `README.md:766` — "Author-name parsing for APA/BibTeX
  (`"First Last"` → `"Last, F."`) is a heuristic — it will mis-format
  multi-word surnames."
- **Where it lives**: `research_agent/citations.py`.
- **Priority**: Unset — needs your call.
- **Status**: Open, not started.

### PDF full-text ingestion
- **Source**: `README.md:761` — "Abstracts only — no PDF full-text
  ingestion (out of scope for v1)."
- **Scope note**: This is a real architectural expansion, not a small
  fix — would touch `ingestion.py` (or a new module), `embeddings.py`
  (what gets chunked/embedded), and likely `summarize.py`/`qa.py`'s
  grounding logic (currently grounded in abstracts specifically).
  Worth its own design pass before implementation, not a drop-in.
- **Priority**: Unset — needs your call.
- **Status**: Open, not started.

### Chat message actions + report inclusion
- **Phases 1–5 (persisted web-answer metadata, message menu/select
  mode, delete exchanges, add web-backed sources to the report, edit
  user question): Done — the whole planned arc is complete.** See
  `docs/architecture.md`'s "Chat feature: message actions and report
  inclusion (Phases 1–5) — complete" section for the full record — data
  model (`exchange_id`/`used_web_search`/`cited_web_articles`/
  `added_to_report`/`report_approved_web_article_urls`), the
  `qa.capped_history()` sanitization boundary, the selective-vs-
  whole-pool report regeneration split, and edit's truncate-and-
  regenerate behavior (new `exchange_id` per edit, `report_possibly_
  stale` reused as-is from Phase 3 — that open question from the
  previous note is now resolved). Final validation: backend 404 passed,
  frontend 154 passed, build clean.
- **Status**: Closed. Follow-up ideas below are optional, not scheduled.

### Chat feature follow-ups (optional, not scheduled)
- **Inline edit UI instead of `window.prompt`.** Phase 5 used the same
  native-dialog minimalism as Phase 3's `window.confirm` on purpose — a
  real inline-editable text field is a plausible future upgrade, not a
  correctness gap.
- **Stale-report remediation/regeneration UX.** `report_possibly_stale`
  (surfaced by both delete and edit) is only ever a warning today — no
  one-click "fix it now" action exists; the user has to know to
  manually regenerate.
- ~~Pruning `report_approved_web_article_urls` after delete/edit~~ —
  **Done (Phase B, 2026-08-03).** See `docs/architecture.md`'s "Phase B
  — approved report-source pruning after delete/edit" section and the
  "Phase B: report-source revocation after delete/edit" entry below.
- **A red-team/evaluation suite for chat + report behavior** —
  nothing in this arc has adversarial/eval-style coverage the way
  `report.py`'s citation-grounding does (`tests/test_report_
  grounding.py`) or the original pipeline's RAGAS harness does
  (`docs/evaluation.md`).
- **Priority**: Unset — needs your call, on any/all of the above.

### Phase B: report-source revocation after delete/edit
- **Goal**: define desired behavior: remove approved URLs only when no
  remaining added-to-report exchange cites them; keep existing report
  marked stale until regenerated.
- **Why it matters**: raised during chat-ux-polish Phase A (frontend-only
  dialog/badge/notice polish) — confirmed deleting a chat exchange did
  NOT remove anything from `web_articles_added` or `report_approved_
  web_article_urls`, so a subsequent regeneration (via either the
  selective or whole-pool path) would still very likely include the same
  reference even after the exchange that cited it was gone. Phase A
  deliberately left this semantic untouched; this was the tracking note
  for the follow-up.
- **Implementation**: `research_agent/curation_chat.py` gained
  `approved_web_article_urls_from_added_to_report_entries()` (pure) and
  `prune_report_approved_web_article_urls()` (mutator, recomputes the
  approved set from scratch as the union of `cited_web_articles` URLs
  over currently `added_to_report=True` assistant entries).
  `delete_chat_exchanges()`/`edit_chat_exchange()` call the latter only
  when `report_possibly_stale` is true. `web_articles_added` and
  `session.report` are untouched; no auto-regeneration; no endpoint,
  schema, or frontend changes. See `docs/architecture.md`'s "Phase B —
  approved report-source pruning after delete/edit" section for the full
  design record.
- **Priority**: n/a — done.
- **Status**: Closed (2026-08-03).

### Phase C: QA web-article relevance gate
- **Goal**: stop the accumulated `web_articles_added` pool from being
  reused blindly on later, unrelated curation-chat turns.
- **Why it matters**: reported as two symptoms of the same root cause —
  (1) nearly every later assistant answer got tagged `used_web_search=
  true` (blue web badge appeared almost everywhere) once one web search
  had ever been accepted in a session, and (2) a genuinely new/unrelated
  follow-up question stopped triggering a fresh web-search offer, because
  the model could always find *something* tangential in the stale pool
  to cite, propping up a false `answerable=true`.
- **Implementation**: `research_agent/qa.py`'s LangGraph gained a new
  node, `filter_web_relevance`, inserted between `retrieve` and
  `route_retrieved`. Cosine-similarity filter (`_filter_relevant_web_
  articles()`) reusing the existing `_embed_with_cache`/`_cosine_
  similarity` helpers — same embedding pathway `classify_message`'s
  non-substantive check already uses. Query = `standalone_query or
  question`; article text = `title + snippet`; threshold = `0.25`
  (documented starting point, not yet calibrated); fails open (keeps the
  unfiltered pool) on any embedding exception. `route_retrieved`'s own
  branching condition and `curation_chat.py`'s offer-and-decide flow are
  both unchanged. `used_web_search` needed no code changes — it derives
  correctly now as a side effect. See `docs/architecture.md`'s "Phase C —
  QA web-article relevance gate" section for the full design record.
- **Follow-ups not done in this phase** (see that same doc section for
  detail): the 0.25 threshold needs live calibration; `answerable` is
  still an LLM judgment call, not a hard rule; paper retrieval
  (`semantic_search`) still has no relevance threshold of its own,
  same as before this phase; `curation_chat.py`'s pending-web-offer flow
  was deliberately not restructured into LangGraph nodes.
- **Priority**: n/a — done.
- **Status**: Closed (2026-08-03).

## 3. Technical debt

Current single-user/backend debt only — scoped to what's actually true
today, cross-referenced to where each item is already tracked in detail:

- **Model-name constants not centralized.** 8 constants
  (`EMBEDDING_MODEL`, `SUMMARY_MODEL`, `REPORT_MODEL`, `AGENT_MODEL`,
  `TITLE_SUGGESTION_MODEL`, `CANONICALIZE_TOPIC_MODEL`, `CONDENSE_MODEL`,
  `ANSWER_MODEL`) across 6 files, several literal duplicates of the same
  string. Optional, not scheduled. See `docs/architecture.md`'s Phase 14
  section, `research_agent/config/settings.py`'s own module docstring.
- **Data/cache/Chroma path constants not centralized.** 4 constants
  (`DATA_DIR`, `DB_PATH`, `CHROMA_PERSIST_DIR`, `QA_CHECKPOINT_DB_PATH`),
  `DATA_DIR` independently duplicated in two files. Same status as
  above — optional, not scheduled, same source.
- **`eval_results/latency_history.csv` has no reproducing script.**
  Referenced directly by `README.md`'s "Search-call parallelization"
  section; no script in `scripts/` currently produces it. See
  `docs/evaluation.md`, `eval_results/archive/README.md`.
- **`api.py`'s compatibility re-exports retirement — deferred.**
  Every schema/helper/runtime object moved out of `api.py` across
  Phases 4–10 is still re-exported from it for `research_agent.api.
  <name>`/`patch.object(api, "<name>", ...)` callers. Retiring any of
  them requires updating every caller in lockstep — not attempted
  incrementally, not scheduled. See `docs/architecture.md`'s Phase 10
  section, `specs/legacy-cleanup-audit.md`'s `api.py` entry.
- **`research_agent/api_app/` → `api/` rename — deferred.** Blocked on
  the re-export retirement above (renaming now would either break
  `patch.object` mocking or require the whole re-export cleanup first).
  Not scheduled. See `docs/architecture.md`'s "Why `research_agent/
  api_app/`, not `research_agent/api/`" section.
- ~~`requirements-frozen-baseline.txt` is stale~~ — **Done (Phase 18B).**
  Archived to `docs/archive/requirements-frozen-baseline.txt` (content
  unchanged, `git mv`'d, not deleted); `docs/archive/README.md` added
  explaining the archive convention. See `specs/legacy-cleanup-audit.md`.
- ~~`research_agent_architecture.svg` is stale relative to current
  architecture~~ — **Done (Phase 18C).** Archived to `docs/archive/
  research_agent_architecture.svg` (content unchanged, `git mv`'d, not
  deleted); `README.md` now points to `docs/architecture.md`'s new
  Mermaid diagram as the current architecture instead. See
  `specs/legacy-cleanup-audit.md`.
- **No numeric pass/fail gate on the RAGAS eval** — still manually run
  and human-interpreted, not CI-enforced. See `docs/evaluation.md`, and
  the Obsidian vault's `Mentor-Feedback.md`/`TODO.md` (surfaced by the
  2026-07-17 mentor review, item 13).
- **Whole-pool `/report/regenerate` can silently discard a selectively-
  curated report.** If a session uses both the chat add-to-report path
  (Phase 4, selective — only approved web sources) and the pre-existing
  Report tab "Regenerate" button (whole-pool — every
  `web_articles_added` entry, approved or not), the whole-pool call will
  overwrite `session.report` with one reflecting the entire raw web
  pool, including sources never approved through chat. The two paths
  don't defer to each other. Documented in
  `research_agent/report.py`'s `regenerate_report_with_approved_web_
  sources` docstring and `docs/architecture.md`'s chat-feature section;
  not fixed, no scheduled owner.
- **No CI configuration exists anywhere in this repo** (confirmed: no
  `.github/workflows/`, no other CI config found). Validation throughout
  this entire project has been manual (`uv run pytest -q`, `npm test`,
  `npm run build`) — works, but isn't enforced automatically on push/PR.
  Noted as debt, not scheduled; `specs/production-readiness-roadmap.md`'s
  Phase 22 ("Config/deployment foundation") is the natural place this
  would eventually get picked up, if the production-readiness arc is
  ever started.

## 4. Explicitly deferred platform work

**Not next. Not implied by anything above.** Each of these already has
its own dedicated design document — this backlog does not duplicate or
re-scope them, only points at them:

- **OAuth/auth** — `specs/production-readiness-roadmap.md` §4.
- **PostgreSQL migration** — `specs/production-readiness-roadmap.md` §5.
- **Multi-user support** — `specs/production-readiness-roadmap.md` §6.
- **Tenant/workspace isolation** — `specs/production-readiness-roadmap.md`
  §2 (product questions), §6 (ownership model).

If any bug fix or feature idea above turns out to actually require one
of these (e.g. a feature idea that only makes sense per-user), that's a
signal to route it into the production-readiness roadmap instead of this
backlog — not to quietly start platform work inside a "backend backlog"
item.

## 5. Suggested backend work process

Recommended, not enforced by tooling (no CI exists yet — see §3):

1. **One bug/feature per branch or commit.** Matches this entire
   project's own established discipline since Phase 0 — small,
   reviewable, independently revertible changes, not bundled ones.
2. **Write a failing/targeted test first where practical.** Mirrors the
   pattern already used repeatedly in this project's own history (e.g.
   Phase 2's two coverage gaps closed *before* moving the routes they
   covered; `research_agent/config/settings.py`'s own
   `tests/test_config_settings.py` added alongside the module it tests).
3. **Run the targeted backend subset before the full suite** —
   `uv run pytest tests/test_<relevant_file>.py -q` first, then
   `uv run pytest -q` before considering the change done. Matches the
   validation cadence used throughout Phases 0–17.
4. **Update the Obsidian notes after meaningful changes** — tell
   Claude/Codex "update the Obsidian notes" once a bug fix or feature
   lands; the vault does not update itself (per its own `Home.md`/setup
   note).
5. **Preserve `standardized-single-user-project` as the rollback
   baseline.** Every future bug fix/feature branch should be able to
   diff cleanly against this tag; if a change ever needs to be reverted
   wholesale, this tag is the known-good point to return to — same role
   `pre-standardization-2026-07-29` and `standardized-single-user-backend`
   already play for their respective arcs.
